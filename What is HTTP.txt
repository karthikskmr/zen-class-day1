What is HTTP:
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.its used for communicating server from client using request and response.
HTTP 1.1:
        HTTP/1.1 was created in 1997.Client sent the request to the server .then the server sent the response for the particular request.
The version HTTP/1.1 first the client and server connection should be established then the data transfer process will be occured.
The connection was not lost here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header which is part of the request.which means several requests & responses are merged in a single connection.
 The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. 
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked by all other requests until the response does not receive. 
All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.
  
HTTP 2:
HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol in the early 2010s. 
HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
 it works on fully multiplexed, that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.


Difference Between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


HTTP/1.1
	HTTP2
	HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. 


	HTTP2 transfers all the requests & responses in the binary form. 
	

There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.


	

It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.


	It compresses data by itself.
	It uses HPACK for data compression.


	

It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages        


	

It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages


	It does not  remove the duplication and overhead of data transmitted.
